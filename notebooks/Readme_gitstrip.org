To set this up so git won't check in images:

1) Add the following to ~/.gitconfig and change the path to your bin:


[filter "nbstrip"]        
      clean = /Users/phil/bin/nbstripout.py
      smudge =cat
      required

2) copy nbstripout.py into your bin and make it executable

3) make sure .gitattributes is in the notebooks directory and
  that it has 

  *.ipynb filter=nbstrip

as it's only line.
