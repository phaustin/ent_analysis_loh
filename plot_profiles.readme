plot_profiles.py
plot_profiles_ent.py

 Read time_profiles data (/tera/users/loh/repos/ent_analysis/cdf) and plot the vertical profiles of the clouds. plot_profiles.py produces a series of plots for SAM statistics ("variables") and plot_profiles_ent.py produces profiles from the entrainment codes.

 The code should run within the git repository.

 Currently, the code filters out the deep clouds, due to the fact that the profiles are very distinctly skewed towards them; to turn this off, find the section of code tagged with # Shallow filters and comment it out (it may be worth writing another code just to plot the deep clouds).
